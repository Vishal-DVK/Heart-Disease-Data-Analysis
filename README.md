Heart Disease Data Analysis using EDA 
Heart disease or Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This is true in all areas of the world except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s.

# Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease dataset
 ### Project Overview
 This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of heart disease data.Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is a critical first step in analyzing a new dataset. The primary objective of EDA is to analyze the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies in the dataset. It enable us to direct specific testing of the hypothesis. It includes analysing the data to find the distribution of data, its main characteristics, identifying patterns and visualizations. It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation.
