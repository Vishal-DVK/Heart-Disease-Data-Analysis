# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis
Heart Disease Data Analysis using EDA 
- Heart disease or Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. This is true in all areas of the world except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s.

# Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease dataset
 ### Project Overview
 This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of heart disease data.Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is a critical first step in analyzing a new dataset. The primary objective of EDA is to analyze the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies in the dataset. It enable us to direct specific testing of the hypothesis. It includes analysing the data to find the distribution of data, its main characteristics, identifying patterns and visualizations. It also provides tools for hypothesis generation by visualizing and understanding the data through graphical representation.

# Key Highlights
### Data Overview
- Analyzed a dataset containing medical information such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, and more.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Converted categorical variables to appropriate formats
- Ensured dataset was analysis-ready

### Data Import and Preperation 
- Pandas: for data manipulation.
- NumPy: for numerical operations.
- Seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
- Matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Univariate and bivariate analysis
 - Histograms, boxplots, countplots, and pairplots for better insights
 - Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables
 - Focused on understanding which features are most associated with heart disease presence

### Insights
  - Identified how factors like age, sex, chest pain type, and cholesterol levels relate to heart disease
  - Visualized trends across different health metrics

 # Conclusion
  Summarized findings that highlighted the importance of certain features in predicting heart disease, paving the way for future machine learning applications.
